# NelexstarMain/IOI_trening

---

This repository, `NelexstarMain/IOI_trening`, serves as a dedicated collection of solutions to competitive programming problems primarily sourced from **Codeforces**.

The main purpose of this repository is to store and organize my practice submissions and accepted solutions, with a focus on improving algorithmic skills relevant to contests like the International Olympiad of Informatics (IOI) and similar competitive programming events.

## What you'll find here:

* **Problem Solutions:** Solutions to various Codeforces problems, typically organized by problem ID or contest.
* **Algorithmic Focus:** The problems tackled cover a wide range of algorithms and data structures, including (but not limited to):
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
    * Data Structures (Trees, Fenwick trees, Segment trees)
    * Greedy Algorithms
    * Binary Search
    * Number Theory
    * String Algorithms
* **Code in Python:** All solutions are primarily implemented in **Python**.

## How to use this repository:

You can browse through the directories to find solutions to specific problems. Each problem solution is generally contained within its own file, often named after the problem ID or a descriptive title.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the approaches, or compare solutions if you're working on similar problems.
